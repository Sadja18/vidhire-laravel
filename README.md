# VidHire: One-Way Video Interview Platform

**Built for Horizon Sphere Equityâ€™s 24-Hour Developer Challenge**

VidHire is a Laravel-based web app for running simple one-way video interviews.
Admins create interviews with questions, candidates submit answers as video links, and reviewers score them â€” all in a browser, no extra apps required.

I normally work with Django, Flask, FastAPI, and Express.js. Laravel was less familiar, but I learned what I needed and shipped this in under 24 hours.

## Features

* Role-based login: **Admin**, **Reviewer**, **Candidate**
* Admin can create interviews and set questions
* Candidate submits a video link (e.g., YouTube unlisted, Cloudinary, etc.)
* Reviewer watches the video, scores (1â€“5), and leaves comments
* Built-in PDF guides for each role
* Responsive UI with Bootstrap 5 and Blade templates

**Note:** Videos are not uploaded directly. Candidates paste a public video link. This kept the project lightweight and achievable within the challenge timeframe.

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install php8.2 php8.2-mysql php8.2-curl php8.2-xml php8.2-mbstring php8.2-zip php8.2-gd php8.2-cli -y
   ```

2. **Install Composer**

   ```bash
   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
   ```

3. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sadja18/vidhire-laravel.git
   cd vidhire
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Install MariaDB & create database**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mariadb-server -y
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

   Then log in and create a database + user:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE vidhire_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   CREATE USER 'vidhire_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON vidhire_db.* TO 'vidhire_user'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   EXIT;
   ```

6. **Update `.env`**

   Edit `.env` to match your DB credentials:

   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=vidhire_db
   DB_USERNAME=vidhire_user
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   ```

7. **Run migrations**

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

8. **Start dev server**

   ```bash
   php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
   ```

   Visit: `http://localhost:8000`

   Default test users (if seeded):

   * `admin@vidhire.com / password123`
   * `candidate@vidhire.com / password123`
   * `reviewer@vidhire.com / password123`

## Final Notes

This was built in 24 hours under time pressure.
It isnâ€™t over-engineered, but it works: you can log in, create interviews, record answers, and review them.

Iâ€™m stronger in Python frameworks, but I adapted to Laravel quickly and delivered.
Thatâ€™s what this project shows â€” the ability to learn fast, make trade-offs, and ship something usable.
